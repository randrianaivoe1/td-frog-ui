## Conclusion
- any reusable colors should be allocated to a global variable in globals.css - with a short description
- all image url should not be hardcoded but assigned to variables indexed in a file or on top of each file
- front-end developpers or CSS integrators can easily modify and improve this code. Other users might struggle.
